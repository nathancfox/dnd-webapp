## Summary

Build a web application that can be used as a document manager and tool provider for a Dungeons and
Dragons player.

## Justification

I want to get experience with web applications and the basics of full stack development. Many, many
software engineering jobs that are consumer facing are web applications. I'm no longer content to be
a solid programmer; I want to be able to build software in the context of a back-end for a web
application. This project aims to kick start my development in this skillset and show something
concrete and complete that I have built, to show future potential employers.

## Description

The web application, referred to hereafter as the **Application**, is a resource for Dungeons and
Dragons players, referred to as **Players**. The edition of Dungeons and Dragons will be 5e. The
Application will not be a resource for Dungeon Masters. The Application is designed for Players who
prefer to electronically keep track of their character and its information, referred to as their
**Character**. It will provide electronically fillable and persistent resources including, but not
limited to the following: a character sheet, a free form notes section, a dice rolling utility, file
storage for images and PDFs.
