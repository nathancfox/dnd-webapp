A web application for managing Dungeons and Dragons 5e character sheets, using
utilities such as dice rollers, and providing a digital interface during play.

## \*\* Under Active Development - Not Functional \*\*

### Current Version : v0.1

A completely minimal version. One static site with no server-side processing.
No persistence, one user, one character, one die, and a limited character
sheet.
